      learnings: "My top three learnings are: always bring an open mind into every consultation; if we pigeon hole our solutions, we miss the nuances. Listen on multiple levels, not only the content but also the delivery and context in which it is said. Finally, have a sense of humour, we are all humans after all and the ability to laugh and find joy in anything can brighten up the saddest of days.",
      approach: "I believe in creating a safe, non-judgmental space where clients feel comfortable exploring their thoughts and feelings. My approach is integrative, drawing from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based techniques, and psychodynamic principles to tailor treatment to each individual's unique needs.\n\nI view therapy as a collaborative process where we work together to identify patterns, develop insights, and create practical strategies for change. My goal is to help you build resilience, improve relationships, and develop a deeper understanding of yourself.",
      sessionExpectations: "In our first session, we'll focus on getting to know each other and understanding what brings you to therapy. I'll ask questions about your history, current challenges, and goals for treatment. From there, we'll develop a treatment plan together that feels right for you. Sessions are typically 50 minutes and can be held weekly or bi-weekly depending on your needs."

  approach: `I believe in a collaborative therapeutic relationship where we work together to understand your experiences and develop strategies for positive change. My approach is tailored to your specific needs and goals, drawing from evidence-based practices that have been shown to be effective.

I focus on helping you develop insight into patterns that may no longer serve you, while building practical skills to navigate life's challenges. Whether you're dealing with specific issues or seeking personal growth, I'm here to support your journey toward greater well-being.`,
